Uploading 481766055-27c4af87-c50f-4df1-bdf4-ddfc17873537.mp4‚Ä¶


This project is a Node.js backend service that performs ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations to build and manage Elasticsearch indexes.  
It exposes secure REST APIs protected with JWT authentication.

## Overview

The system extracts data from various sources, processes and transforms it, and then loads the results into Elasticsearch for fast searching and analytics.  
All API endpoints are secured using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to ensure only authorized access.

## Features

- ETL pipeline for structured and unstructured data
- Elasticsearch integration for indexing and querying
- Secure APIs with JWT authentication
- Configurable environment variables
- Modular Node.js architecture
